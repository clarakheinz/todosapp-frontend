# Todos App with MERN

## Background/Purpose
I wanted to learn how to program in REACT so this front end is just that since we are learning MERN! 

## How to build
Pull down this lovely little codebase, then open a terminal at your workspace location (or easily in VSCode).
Run npm start and you should be good to go.

## Goals
(*) Add styling cause she ugly right now
(*) Add a trashcan button to delete todos because some of them are dumb
(*) Fluff up the Todo Detials page...surely there is more to say
(*) Think of actually relevant features
